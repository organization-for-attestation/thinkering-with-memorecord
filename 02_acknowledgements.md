# Acknowledgements

"It takes a village", they say. Originally, this proverb refers to raising a child. Somehow, this thesis is it, a child, and to a great extent, this is the fruit of a community effort. First of all, I would like to sincerely thank every person who contributed to the realisation of Memorecord. Your energy and willingness to build and animate it with me were fundamental to make it happen. Thanks for having joined the harvest! I am also thankful to the Luxembourg National Research Fund and to the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History for their financial and institutional support to my project. 

As I write these acknowledgements, many faces are popping up in my mind. Perhaps due to the habit of the profession, I tend to go far back in time thinking about everybody who supported me in the educational path that brought me to Luxembourg: my birth family and my dear Único school teachers. Família querida, especialmente minha mãezinha e Caroline, pelo perene cuidado que atravessa oceanos. E também, meus amores Únicos: Memelo, Thuenny, Pedro, e Magah, obrigada por terem sempre me encorajado a olhar além do Soberbo. Não sabia que depois da Baía de Guanabara eu viria parar tão longe, graças ao estímulo e apoio que vocês me deram. À minha família do coração, os Moura Ribeiro, deixo meu abraço co-movido como desde a primeira descida da Serra. 

For becoming a historian, after them, I am in high debt with the Brazilian public university. Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro was the venue of my first passions as a historian: teaching, methods, theory. To my UFRJ's fellows, I am deeply grateful for the indelible mark of resistance and contestation they left on me, with special mentions to Manoel Salgado (*in* *memoriam*) and Andrea Casanova for the encouragement to begin and stay in research. Bridging Rio and Sergipe, it was digital history that brought me to the same path as Dilton Maynard. Dotô, infinitos obrigadas pelas nossas perenes trocas, pelo respeito e amizade. No caminho para esta tese, nossas trocas me levaram a lágrimas, me ampararam e inspiraram a seguir.

On my way to Luxembourg, before becoming a member of the jury, Serge Noiret is most responsible for... *everything*. Serge was the one who introduced me, back in 2008, to the very first references on digital history after I had chased him at the European University Institute. Grazie mille per avermi presentato questa strada, Serge e poi, quella della Public History, che ci ha portato altrove insieme: Ottawa, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Bogota, Ravenna ed ora Esch-sur-Alzette.

In the Grand Duchy, I could not have been more lucky. If I was looking for hands-on experience with the digital when I left Brazil, I met the right environment and the most enthusiastic companion for this explorative journey. Andreas Fickers, beyond being a super approachable supervisor, over these past years, have showed me in many ways how life in academia can be adventuresome, human and gratifying. Andreas, there would not be enough words to express my gratitude to your support and encouragement along this way; acknowledgements should also allow inline multimedia, multisensorial content. I learned a lot with you, about research and about being a researcher, and for this I thank you the most. Thank you also for taking the risks with me. 

Teaming up with Andreas and Serge, Elisabeth Boesen, reminded me along the way that I also belonged to the *second floor*. Elisabeth, apart from your generous intellectual attitude as one of my in-house supervisors, I have to thank you a million for the numerous times you let me pop into your office for academic and non-academic reasons. Thanks for the teaching invitations, for the improvised coffee breaks and your always remarkable, considerate listening, deeply appreciated both in times of excitement and crisis. 

I wish I could have more moments of exchange with the other members of my jury as I had with my Thesis Supervisory Committee. I hope academia will present us with further encounters in the near future. For now, I am most thankful to Machteld Venken, Jane Winters and Thomas Cauvin for having accepted to take part in such an important moment of my career path, my life, indeed. Machteld, Jane and Thomas, I was thrilled when we confirmed you would be taking part in my PhD Defence Jury. Thank you very much for your time and willingness in reading my work and being available to enrich this discussion with your expertise. 

I could not have gone through all these years of intense work in Luxembourg and so many ups and downs in my personal life without counting on the friendship and support of my Luxembourg ambassadors - Marinella, Thierry and Nicolas - and my C2DH crew. The *saudade* from home and the bitter surprises of life became a bit easier with you guys. Obrigada! Grazie! Merci! Thank you very much to you all, with special thanks to Dominique, Shohreh, Jessica, Fabio and Richard for their hugs, the laughs, the meals together, the drinks and the eventual group therapies. On the other side of the corridor, to my savior and hero of all the hours, Daniele! Grazie infinite, Dani. Per tutto, ma soprattutto per aver messo tanto cuore in tutto ciò che abbiamo costruito per Memorecord. 

*Digital Hemeneutics... What Else? Ask Brigitte, she knows everything!* My dear Brigitte, I will miss you. I wanted to thank you deeply for everything you did to me, but most importantly for the Brazilian hug style. It was a real chance to have around and I know that concluding this PhD would not have been the same without your moral, emotional and administrative support, above all in one of the most critical moments in my life. I do not forget your calls, your emails, your kindness. 

Arriving at the end of this journey was almost an Odyssey, I often thought about it. Moving here and there, hospitals, trains, trolleys, tents, apartments, places in North and South. It would not have been possible without holding hands with my Barbara. Vida, eu não poderia chegar lá (aqui? aonde mesmo? horas são?) sem você ao meu lado, me encorajando com a força dos Guimarães que te incorpora. E aqui aproveito para agradecer imensamente à D. Clea pela coragem enviada todos os dias. Te agradecer pra valer pela valentia através de todos os perrengues é impossível. Só posso te dizer do quão lisonjeada sou pela tua companhia e por dividir contigo e com nossos peludos esse momento tão singular da minha vida. Que sigamos compartilhando a vida boa, mas quem sabe, daqui pra frente, com menos trechinhos, edições, correções e correrias. Obrigada por cuidar de mim e da tua xará e de formar com ela a dupla mais bárbara de encerramento de trabalhos jamais vista na face da terra. Babica, te agradeço de novo porque uma só vez é pouco. 

And going back to the trains... Andy, my friend, thanks a million for embarking with me, to Aachen, to Lisbon, Kautenbach and elsewhere. You taught me many things, beyond scanning, tiny and great ones. Your 360 reading of Memorecord and your 360 friendship made Luxembourg home again after some great times of despair. Thanks for being there, holding my back, scanning my books, writing me notes, reading my drafts, bringing masks and alcohol gel to my door, walking my dog... I am so glad you are part of our pack. 

And beyond Belval? *Coisas Bunitas*, mapas astrais, sonoros poderosos para a escrita, cozinha cheirando a bolo fresco, gargalhadas adultas e risadas de neném. Anne, Duci, Heidi, Luisa, obrigada pela acolhida, pelas trocas, pelos ombros e ouvidos emprestados. Heidinha, haja *bareilless*! Obrigada pela partilha, pela leitura, pelas filmagens e pelas palhaçadas que tornaram essa aventura menos angustiante. 

To my friends spread over the world in different time zones and quarantine regimes, I only wish I could meet you all in a *boteco* at the end of this long day. COVID may prevent us from reuniting as soon as I wish, and that saddens me. But it is a great relief to know that you are there and we may talk over the *tira-gostos* of this thesis in no time. Gensa, mentre scrivo questo penso a te, alle nostre risate e alla nostra amicizia. Grazie per avermi insegnato tanto di quello che sai, dalla schiuma per il macchiato al fiorentino più sestese di tutta Toscana. Per la tua immensa pazienza in accompagnarmi così da vicino in questa mia lunga camminata verso la storia, grazie.

And to the team of proofreading and emotional support warriors, I can only hope to be there for you when you need me like I needed you. Jessica, Cale, Kanu, Rodrigo and Aryana, thanks for following me along this journey. It felt so good sharing part of this process with you. Chloé, Karina, Eliza, Gil, Poly, Harley, Jose, Marilia, Rapha, vocês também, de maneiras diferentes, me ajudaram a compor o grande quebra cabeças deste trabalho. Obrigada sempre pela escuta.
